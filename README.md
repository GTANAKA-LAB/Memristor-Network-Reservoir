# Memristor-Network-Reservoir

  ## File description
  In our work ([Tanaka and Nakane, Sci. Rep., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13687-z)), we presented a simulation platform for pattern recognition based on reservoir computing with memristor networks. We demonstrated the results of three pattern classification tasks including waveform classification, ECG classification, and spoken digit recognition. In this repository, we provide the codes and simulation tools for performing these tasks.
  
  ## Directories
  * ECG: electrocardiogram classification 
  * waveform: waveform classification
  * Word: spoken digit recognition
  Please see the readme file in each directory for details.

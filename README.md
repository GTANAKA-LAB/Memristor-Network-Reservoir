# Memristor-Network-Reservoir
In our work ([Tanaka and Nakane, Sci. Rep., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13687-z)), we presented a simulation platform for pattern recognition based on reservoir computing with memristor networks. We demonstrated the results of three pattern classification tasks including waveform classification, ECG classification, and spoken digit recognition. In this repository, we provide the MATLAB codes and simulation tools for performing these tasks.
  
  ## Directories
  * ECG: electrocardiogram classification 
  * Waveform: waveform classification
  * Word: spoken digit recognition
  
  The details can be found in the readme file in each directory.

# Memristor-Network-Reservoir

  ## File description
  In our work (G. Tanaka and R. Nakane, Sci. Rep. 2022), we presented a simulation platform of reservoir computing with memristor networks for pattern classification. We demonstrated three tasks including waveform classification, ECG classification, and spoken digit recognition. In this repository, we provide the simulation platform for performing these tasks.

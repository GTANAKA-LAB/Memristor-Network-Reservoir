# Memristor-Network-Reservoir

  ## File description
  In our work ([Tanaka and Nakane, Sci. Rep., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13687-z)), we presented a simulation platform of reservoir computing with memristor networks for pattern classification. We demonstrated three tasks including waveform classification, ECG classification, and spoken digit recognition. In this repository, we provide the simulation platform for performing these tasks.
  
  ## Directories
  * ECG: electrocardiogram classification 
  * waveform: waveform classification
  * Word: spoken digit recognition
  Please see the readme file in each directory for details.

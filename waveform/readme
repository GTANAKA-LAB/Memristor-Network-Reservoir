In the waveform classification task, we aim to classify sinusoidal and triangular waveforms. 
The amplitudes of the waves are the same, but the frequencies of them are different.

(1) In "data" folder, the datasets including 100 sine and 100 triangular waves are generated with the command
> main

(2) In "reservoir_response" folder, the response of the memristor network reservoir is shown with the command
> main

(3) In "reservoir_computing" folder, the classification is performed with the command
> main
